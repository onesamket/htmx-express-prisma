## htmx todo application using express server

### about htmx

- htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext
- htmx is small (~14k min.gzâ€™d), dependency-free, extendable, IE11 compatible & has reduced code base sizes by 67% when compared with react.

## motivation

- Why should only <a> and <form>beable to make HTTP requests?
- Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
- Why should only GET & POST methods be available?
- Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?
